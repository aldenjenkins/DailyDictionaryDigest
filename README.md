# DailyDictionaryDigest

-   Send out an email with a digest of a random selection of words and their corresponding definitions.

### Intuition
-   A great exercise for perpetual mental acquity and a robust vocabularity

### Notes
-   We build the list of words within python by directly constructing a dictionary from a json file. This is more
    performant than loading a list of new-line-deliminated words.
